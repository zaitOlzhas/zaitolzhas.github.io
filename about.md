Hi, I'm Olzhas, and I'm been working as a software developer for more than 10 years now, and this is my blog. 

### More Information

I'm more focused on the backend development, but now I'm interested in creating complex buisness solutions using the latest technologies of Microsoft such as Dynamics 365, Power Platform, Azure, and others. This blog is about me going through various difficulties and challenges that I face while working on different projects. I will share my experience and knowledge with you. I hope you will find it useful.
